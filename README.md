# Onchain Liquidity Intelligence Engine

A high-quality Web3 reference project designed to demonstrate how decentralized exchange liquidity, token routing, and swap simulation can be modeled and analyzed across modern blockchain networks.

This repository focuses on building a clean, beginner-friendly architecture for tracking liquidity pools, estimating price impact, simulating swap routes, and monitoring token flow using professional Web3 development practices.

## Supported Networks

- Ethereum  
- Base  
- Polygon  
- Arbitrum  

---

## Project Goals

- Demonstrate how on-chain liquidity systems work
- Simulate token swap paths across decentralized exchanges
- Estimate price impact and slippage before execution
- Track liquidity pool health and token movement
- Teach Web3 architecture using clean, readable code

---

## Architecture Overview

This project is structured using a modular root-only file system. Each file handles a specific responsibility:

- Network configuration
- RPC connection handling
- Liquidity pool modeling
- Swap simulation engine
- Analytics and reporting
- Entry point runner

This structure reflects real-world blockchain tooling used in professional Web3 environments.

## Features

- Multi-chain RPC connection support
- Token swap simulation engine
- Liquidity pool depth analysis
- Slippage and price impact estimation
- Real-time analytics logging
- Beginner-friendly code structure

---

## How It Works

1. The system connects to a blockchain RPC provider.
2. Liquidity pools are loaded from configuration.
3. A swap simulation engine calculates optimal routes.
4. Price impact and slippage are estimated.
5. Analytics are generated and displayed in the console.
